# GroupThink
Software Engineering Project CS115 (UCSC Fall 2016)

GroupThink: Web application that facilitates team creation for group projects in an educational setting. Professors create a class/project portal that allows students to input data and match with other students. Stretch goals include matching based on technical skills, working style, class/work schedule, and project ideas.

This application is a reaction to the fact that in a software engineering class in the year 2016, we're using a spreadsheet to sign up for and coordinate group projects. Piazza also has a search for teammates funtion that professors can use, but it's essentially a spreadsheet with comments. Giving students more paramaters to match and make teams will facilitate better learning environments.

It is also a reaction to the faculty to student ratio at UCSC. Many classes now have to rely on group projects to make grading possible. This can be a great learning experience but can be a hurdle for many students that struggle to find a group they fit into.
