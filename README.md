# GroupThink
Software Engineering Project CS115 (UCSC Fall 2016)

GroupThink: Web application that facilitates team creation for group projects in an educational setting. Professors create a class/project portal that allows students to input data and match with other students. Stretch goals include matching based on technical skills, working style, class/work schedule, and project ideas.

Reaction to the fact that in a software engineering class in the year 2016, we're using a spreadsheet to sign up for and coordinate group projects. Piazza also has a search for teammates funtion that professors can use, but it's essentially a spreadsheet with comments. Giving students more paramaters to match and make teams will facilitate better learning environments.
